# Nickelodeon HLS Proxy Server

A simple Node.js Express server that proxies and rewrites HLS playlists and video segments from a Nickelodeon source URL. This allows streaming HLS content through your own server, enabling control over access or custom processing.

---

## Features

- Fetches original `.m3u8` playlist and rewrites segment URLs to route via this proxy
- Streams `.ts` video segments on demand
- Compatible with any HLS player
- Easy to set up and deploy

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Basic knowledge of command line usage

---

## Setup & Installation

1. **Clone this repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nickelodeon-hls-proxy.git
   cd nickelodeon-hls-proxy
````

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Verify the server code**

   Your main server file `server.js` should proxy the playlist and segments as described.

---

## Running the Server Locally

Start the server with:

```bash
node server.js
```

By default, it runs on port `3000`. You can override this by setting the `PORT` environment variable:

```bash
PORT=8080 node server.js
```

---

## How to Use

Open your HLS-compatible player (like VLC, Safari, or video.js) and load:

```
http://localhost:3000/playlist.m3u8
```

The server will serve the proxied playlist and stream `.ts` segments through your Node.js proxy.

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint                                                 | Description                                |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `GET /playlist.m3u8`                                     | Returns the proxied and rewritten playlist |
| `GET /segments/:year/:month/:day/:hour/:minute/:segment` | Streams requested `.ts` segment file       |

---

## Deployment

This server can be deployed to any Node.js hosting service. Here’s a quick guide for **Render.com**:

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository.

2. Create a new Web Service on Render.

3. Connect your GitHub repo.

4. Set the build command to:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. Set the start command to:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

6. Render will assign a public URL; use this URL to access `/playlist.m3u8`.

---

## Troubleshooting

* Make sure `node-fetch` and `express` packages are installed.
* Check network access to the original Nickelodeon source.
* Use logs (`console.log`) for debugging segment fetching issues.
